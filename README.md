Here is my reads app project :) and here are the steps I've made to complete it .
1) npm install to install all package I need and added the brwoser router
2) npm start to run the project on the browser.
3) Dividing the repeated elements like books,shelves into components and deleting the static repeated books
and making it dynamic.
4) Making route path to the main page and the search page.
5) setting up the shelves changer functions.
6) setting up the search function for other books.
